# LIP Stat

Tell me what machines at the LIP are not being used too much.

Usage: 
```
./wsstat.sh <machine>   # To get a single machine's load
./lipstat.sh            # To sort all machines by their load
```

## TODO

Get the list of machines directly from the [LIP list](http://intralip.lip.ens-lyon.fr/services/node_spec.html) (only from the intranet).
